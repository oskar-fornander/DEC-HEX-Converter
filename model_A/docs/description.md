# DEC–HEX Converter, Model A

Electronics Kit

Looking for a sleek, physical device to quickly convert between decimal and hexadecimal values? This is the kit for you! You get the satisfaction of soldering and assembling it yourself, turning it into a rewarding and functional project.

* **Fast conversion** between decimal and hexadecimal numbers—in both directions.
* The **rotary encoder** provides responsive and precise tactile feedback, featuring distinct steps for each value increment/decrement.
* **Rotate** to count up/down, and **press** to reset the counter to zero.
* Values are displayed simultaneously in decimal and hexadecimal form using **seven-segment displays** (the color of the displays may vary from the images).
* Dedicated power switch for **on/off** control.
* Powered by **3 AAA batteries**. Provides over **10 hours of active use**.
* **Automatic sleep mode** after a few minutes of inactivity to save battery life. The display will blink intermittently to remind you to power the unit off.
* The brain is an **ATtiny85/45 microcontroller**, and shift registers are used to drive the displays.
* Comes with a **3D-printed enclosure**.
* Delivered as a complete kit with carefully selected, high-quality components, a **pre-programmed microcontroller**, and a custom-designed **PCB**—making for simple assembly and excellent **soldering practice**.
* The microcontroller (ATtiny85/45) is pre-programmed but can be **re-programmed**. The source code is available on GitHub.
* All components are well-sorted and packaged in a box.

**Cost: 599 SEK** (Can also be purchased pre-assembled for +500 SEK).

Shipping as a trackable package with Postnord: 59 SEK

(Also check out Model B, which uses an LCD instead of seven-segment displays and shows binary values as well, but requires slightly less soldering.)
